It is OK to be used as a service but mostly you cannot cover all the points in one day. Though its convenient its not worth it.
Good initiative by Delhi Tourism which takes you to tourist places in Delhi. You can hop on and hop off these buses to places you want to visit. Bus frequency every 40 minutes and if you miss, next 40 minutes you have to wait! APP they have for bus timing doesn't work. Avoid if you are not in group and you can easily take autos in Delhi to see all these places which take 50-6- Rs. and you can save time.
Very Bad plan of Delhi Ho Ho service... ..will not recommend any one, there is no morning schedule for Humayun Tombs, Kutub Minar, Lotus Temple, purana quila... They don,t have Delhi Zoo, Akshar Dhaam, Birla Mandir ( . except Monday), Tuglaka Bad Fort in there list .. they have created 20 place list including... Sarojini Market.. , Lajpat Nagar Market, Ina Market, Chandni Chowk market... Interesting thing they have visit schedule of market in Morning also while markets opens after 11:00 AM. if any one is planning to see delhi don't go with Ho Ho service
The ride on the Delhi Metro was an interesting experience. Though I had gone a short distance the metro was on time and a less painstaking way to get to my location. Though once I got out my car was waiting for me. It sure saved time, since Delhi traffic can get unforgiving.
The delhi metro although has become the lifeline of Delhi, but in recent years the metro becomes overcrowded during peak hours and the journey becomes very uncomfortable for the commuters.
Delhi Metro is nothing like the Metro you would see in Dubai or other western and far eastern locations .... it is very busy and more like a train station then a metro - but definitely a life line for those communiting regularly. Easy to access - good with its timing and excellent signage. Try and travel during off peak hours to avoid the crowds and get a chance of getting a seat in the trains.
Although it's one of the best transport option available in the city but the service is not of good quality, it is mostly over crowded during peak hours which is causing trouble for the commuters.Govt must take steps to improve the service and start metro on new roots as soon as possible.
Come anytime you will find it very crowded. People push you a lot which is not good. Everybody is in a hurry to get a seat not sure why? And I mean everybody even ythey have to get doan at the next station. Still it is fast and you can use it if you want to avoid traffic on roads during peak hours. Will not recommend it to foreigners.
